# Grocery-Cart-Analysis

Instacart is an online grocery delivery service. Customers using the app place orders for goods, which are then hand-delivered to their homes. This service is especially useful when a global pandemic has confined many people to their homes. Imagine a Sunday morning where you look at your schedule for the next few days after your socially distanced morning hike. Your refrigerator needs to be restocked, but the weekend flocks at the grocery store bore you. Monday and Tuesday are jam-packed with Zoom meetings, and you'll be supervising your kids' remote learning as well. In short, you're not going to the grocery store anytime soon. So, you take out your phone, launch the Instacart app, and choose your preferred grocery store. You go through your previously purchased items, look at specials, look for a new key-lime sparkling water that a friend recommended, and then choose a delivery window. We compared the accuracy of various models in this project. We present a thorough comparative study of various machine learning models on the Instacart dataset. It will enable us to provide a more credible recommended list that is tailored, personalized, and targeted to each user, as well as a better customer experience.
